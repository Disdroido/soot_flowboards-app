**R1. Description **



**Purpose:**

Creating a website for a startup surfboard company, that currently does not have one, to facilitate a place to promote and sell boards. Recent trends have shown an increased demand for small business owners to have landing pages, due to over-reliance on Instagram resulting in dropped sales when the social media app globally crashed several times in past months. Our client Jacob (SOOT Flowcraft) has reached out to us to develop a beautiful website where his clients can make customisation and purchase requests.



**Functionality/features:**

- Authentication - ability to create an account/ sign in

- Cart 

- Admin view

-  Active Storage 

- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 

- Purchase existing surfboards on the website

- Ability to request a custom surfboard with image upload functionality

  

**Target audience:**

Surfing enthusiasts in Sydney that are seeking high-end, handmade surfboards that are bespoke in form and function. 



**Tech Stack:**

- MongoDB

- ExpressJS

- ReactJS 

- NodeJS

- EmailJS

- TailwindCSS

- Firebase
